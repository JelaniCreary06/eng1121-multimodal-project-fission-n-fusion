Note this is NOT a professional resume project.

The quiz questions, HTML, and CSS were generated with the help of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) by OpenAI.
The javascript functions were all created, and designed by me (i'm not confident in front-end so I stick to back-end).
All quiz questions were also double checked for accuracy.
